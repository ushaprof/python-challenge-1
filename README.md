Module 2 Challenge involves setting up a food truck order system with a specific set of food items under specific menu categories, and their listed prices.
The menu categories are Snacks, Meals, Drinks and Desserts.
Each menu category has a list of available items with its listed price.

The order system is set up to notify customer of items that are available and those that ar not available.
After each ordered item, customer is asked they would like to order more items.  
After customer has indicated that there are no more items to order, final order is printed out listing total order price alongwith each menu item's total cost and quantities ordered.
